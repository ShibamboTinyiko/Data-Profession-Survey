Real life dataset taken from a survey conducted online to gain various insights into the "Data" field from experts, students etc. within or those making a switch. 

Dataset gathered from online platforms, and exported into an Excel sheet - (Credit to Alex Freberg for the dataset)
Imported the data into PowerBI and performed the following: 
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation in power query (performed tasks such as conditional formating, filtering, removing null entries, splitting columns etc.)
2. Plotted the data onto the viz canvas to gain insigths such as: (Viz with screenshots and video clip included) 
   * Number of survey participants, and their average age 
   * Country of origin
   * Average Salaries by job title 
   * Average Salary by gender
   * Barrier to entry, considering gender 
  
The dataset is quite considerable and this was just a few of the insights learnt, and I will be digging in more.
